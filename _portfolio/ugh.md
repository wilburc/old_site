# Background

There’s no doubting the stress-relieving, cathartic value in complaining or confession. 

However, as *millenials*, we’ve fostered a culture around it. We love it — it’s not uncommon for someone to just, for the lack of a better term, go *off*, listing the trivialities of the day.

Whether or not this behavior is annoying is up to you — some might find it annoying or entitled for people to complain about such insignificant things. 

But sometimes people really *do* want to complain about the little frivolities.

Meanwhile, the person being complained to is indifferent and defaults to generic feigned sympathy. 

# Make a thing

I though it would be hilarious to make a bot to complain to — one that doesn’t try to empathize with you or be your therapist (like *Siri* — gross), but just listen to you and sympathize. It validates your complaints regardless of validity — it doesn’t do any more than you want.

On a more serious note, I did want to create a safe space where people having difficulty with bottled-up feelings could express themselves. 

I described the idea as “SmarterChild meets Online Diaries.” 

### Goals
This product provides: 

- A safe, confidential place for anyone to complain about anything.
- Stress-relief
- Sympathy
- Laughter and eye-rolling

All while satirizing the so-called online rant of the millenial — *canned, insincere responses at set intervals*. 

I mocked-up my idea in Balsamiq. It included sliders for the bot’s “personality,” as well as an on/off switch.

Chat-logs could be sent to one’s e-mail, for storage/organization/sharing with friends. Otherwise, it was to be confirmed in the copy that the records would be erased forever.

# Feedback

People thought it was pretty funny but also really dumb — which was totally fine with me.

One thing that people did mention though, was that they would still be hestitant to really ”chat” with this bot, saying it wasn’t “secure,” or “trustworthy.” 

In terms of actual security, I don’t know much about how privacy and secure storage of data works online. However, as I was aiming for a prototype, I was more interested in security in an emotional sense. 

### Promoting confidentiality and truth

One of my favorite movies is the classic, [*The Princess Bride (1987)*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093779/). Something quite unique about the movie is how the main story is “framed” by the scenes from Ben Savage’s character’s bedroom. While they may seem unnecessary, they help the viewer suspend disbelief, immersing themselves in this fantastic world. Similarly, a confessional in a church’s walls, apart from creating anonymity, isolates the subject in a world that they enter and then leave, framing this experience and removing the actual confession from the rest of their life.

To emulate these experiences, I simply created a separate landing page and a conclusion page. The goal was to represent the chat as a separated experience, removing hesitation and the judgments of real life.

# Final Product

Despite how simple and ridiculous “ugh.” is, I’m still quite proud of it and love linking it to people as a joke, when they’re trying to vent. I love how it started from a stupid idea into a real, working application, and has a funny story behind its conception. 

Built with love, but mostly <a href='https://www.meteor.com/'>Meteor JS</a>. 

You can vent to “SympathyBot” (name not final) <a href='/ugh' target='_blank'>here</a>.
