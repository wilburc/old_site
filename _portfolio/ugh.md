## Background

There’s no doubting the stress-relieving, cathartic value in complaining or confession. 

However, as *millennials*, we’ve fostered a culture around it. We love it — it’s not uncommon for someone to just, for the lack of a better term, go *off* regarding the trivialities of the day.

Whether or not this behavior is annoying is up to you — some might find it annoying or entitled for people to complain about such insignificant things. 

But sometimes people really *do* want to complain about life’s frivolities.

Meanwhile, the person being complained to is indifferent and defaults to generic feigned sympathy. 

## Ask other millennials

I know for a fact, that everyone complains every once in a while. While I know why *I* complain, you really never know what goes on in *other* people’s noodles. I asked some of my friends (college students, millennials, horrible people), why and how they complained. 

### Why do you complain? 
- “Because my life *sucks*”
- “It feels good to just get it out there, ya know?”
- “Sometimes I just have nothing to talk about, and it’s awkward. Everyone relates when I complain”
- “Everyone else does it all the time, I just want to fit in”
- “To receive sympathy, haha”

### Why *don’t* you complain?
- “It feels bad, my life isn’t the worst thing. It’s petty”
- “I don’t want people to think I’m annoying“
- “I want to complain so much, but I bet people find it annoying“

### How do you complain?
- “In-person, if I’m with someone. I wouldn’t go out of my way to vent in-person. Otherwise, online”
- ”Definitely over messaging”
- “Online”

It was no surprise that people loved to complain–for good reason, too. It makes them feel better to get things off their chest, or just have someone sympathize with them. I then brought up my idea.

### Have you ever tried complaining to like, an online bot?
- “No.”

### Why not? Do you want to?
- “Haha I’d think about it, if there were one to complain to.”
- “Never really thought about it.”

 We tried complaining to some existing bots, such as <a href='http://www.cleverbot.com/'>CleverBot</a> and <a href='https://www.chatbots.org/chatbot/a.l.i.c.e/'>A.L.I.C.E.</a>. It became apparent that they were not suitable for complaining, given our existing learnings. When complained to, they offered no sympathy, but rather asked questions. Also, online bots are typically programmed to generate a response for every line you send. But when complaining online, who types out an entire coherent thought before pressing enter? Based on my own experience and observations, when truly passionate/furious about something, people <br>
type<br>
like<br>
*this*.


## Make a thing

I though it would be hilarious to make a bot to complain to — one that doesn’t try to empathize with you or be your therapist (like *Siri* — gross), but just listen to you and sympathize. It validates your complaints regardless of validity — it doesn’t do any more than you want.

On a more serious note, I did want to create a safe space where people having difficulty with bottled-up feelings could express themselves. 

I described the idea as “SmarterChild meets Online Diaries.” 

### Goals
This product provides: 

- A safe, confidential place for anyone to complain about anything.
- Stress-relief
- Sympathy
- Eye-rolling

All while satirizing the so-called online rant of the millenial — *canned, insincere responses at set intervals*. 

I mocked-up my idea in Balsamiq. It included sliders for the bot’s “personality,” as well as an on/off switch.

Chat-logs could be sent to one’s e-mail, for storage/organization/sharing with friends. Otherwise, it was to be confirmed in the copy that the records would be erased forever.

## Feedback

People thought it was pretty funny but also really dumb — which was totally fine with me.

One thing that people did mention though, was that they would still be hestitant to really ”chat” with this bot, saying it wasn’t “secure,” or “trustworthy.” 

In terms of actual security, I don’t know much about how privacy and secure storage of data works online. However, as I was aiming for a prototype, I was more interested in security in an emotional sense. 

### Promoting confidentiality and disclosure

One of my favorite movies is the classic, [*The Princess Bride (1987)*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093779/). Something quite unique about the movie is how the main story is “framed” by the scenes from Fred Savage’s character’s bedroom. While they may seem unnecessary, they help the viewer suspend disbelief, immersing themselves in this fantastic world. Similarly, a confessional in a church’s walls, apart from creating anonymity, isolates the subject in a world that they enter and then leave, framing this experience and removing the actual confession from the rest of their life.

To emulate these experiences, I simply created a separate landing page and a conclusion page. The goal was to represent the chat as a separated experience, removing the hesitation and judgments of real life — the user is temporarily freed from their world.

## Final Product

Despite how simple and ridiculous “ugh.” is, I’m still quite proud of it and love linking it to people as a joke, when they’re trying to vent. I still reference it every now and then in discussion regarding millennials and rant culture, and it’s always funny to show or link to people. 

Built with love, but mostly <a href='https://www.meteor.com/'>Meteor JS</a>. 

You can vent to “SympathyBot” (name not final) <a href='/ugh' target='_blank'>here</a>.
