- It’s stupid — I know.

<!-- # Background

There’s no doubting the stress-relieving, cathartic value in complaining or confession. Whether it be in a church confessional, face-to-face, or online, there are probably some psychological studies regarding the positive effects it has on one’s mental state.

However, as *millenials*, we’ve fostered a culture around it. We love it. It’s not uncommon for someone to just, for the lack of a better term, go *off*, going on about the trivialities of the day.

An online trend that I’ve observed (and been on both sides of) is the above example of a modern online rant. As someone who claims to only be a millenial “ironically,” I really try *not* to do this. We’re generally quite privileged in life, and don’t truly have much to complain about. I’d feel guilty going off about something insignificant, placing importance on my well-being and entitlement to sympathy. 

But sometimes people really *do* want to complain about the little frivolities.

Meanwhile, the person being complained to is indifferent and defaults to generic feigned sympathy. 

# Make a thing

So I though it would be *hilarious* to make a bot to complain to — one that doesn’t try to empathize with you or be your therapist (like *Siri*), but just listen to you and sympathize. It validates your complaints regardless of validity — it doesn’t do any more than you want.

I described the idea as “SmarterChild meets Online Diaries.” 

### Goals

- Provide a safe, confidential place for anyone to complain about anything.
- Provide stress-relief
- Provide sympathy

All while satirizing the so-called online rant of the millenial.

I quickly mocked-up my idea in Balsamiq. It included sliders to toggle the bot’s “personality,“ as well as a toggle to turn it on or off.

Chat-logs could be sent to one’s e-mail, for storage/organization/sharing with friends. Otherwise, it was to be confirmed in the copy that the records would be erased forever.
