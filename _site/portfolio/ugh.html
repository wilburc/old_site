</ul>

<h1 id="background">Background</h1>

<p>There’s no doubting the stress-relieving, cathartic value in complaining or confession. Whether it be in a church confessional, face-to-face, or online, there are probably some psychological studies regarding the positive effects it has on one’s mental state.</p>

<p>However, as <em>millenials</em>, we’ve fostered a culture around it. We love it. It’s not uncommon for someone to just, for the lack of a better term, go <em>off</em>, going on about the trivialities of the day.</p>

<p><img src="/files/ugh_background.png" alt="ugh background" title="ugh. background" /></p>

<p>An online trend that I’ve observed (and been on both sides of) is the above example of a modern online rant. As someone who claims to only be a millenial “ironically,” I really try <em>not</em> to do this. We’re generally quite privileged in life, and don’t truly have much to complain about. I’d feel guilty going off about something insignificant, placing importance on my well-being and entitlement to sympathy.</p>

<p>But sometimes people really <em>do</em> want to complain about the little frivolities.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the person being complained to is indifferent and defaults to generic feigned sympathy.</p>

<h1 id="make-a-thing">Make a thing</h1>

<p>So I though it would be <em>hilarious</em> to make a bot to complain to — one that doesn’t try to empathize with you or be your therapist (like <em>Siri</em>), but just listen to you and sympathize. It validates your complaints regardless of validity — it doesn’t do any more than you want.</p>

<p>I described the idea as “SmarterChild meets Online Diaries.”</p>

<h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Provide a safe, confidential place for anyone to complain about anything.</li>
  <li>Provide stress-relief</li>
  <li>Provide sympathy</li>
</ul>

<p>All while satirizing the so-called online rant of the millenial.</p>

<p>I mocked-up my idea in Balsamiq. It included sliders for the bot’s “personality,” as well as an on/off switch.</p>

<p><img src="/files/ugh_initial.png" alt="ugh initial mockup" title="ugh. initial mockup" /></p>

<p>Chat-logs could be sent to one’s e-mail, for storage/organization/sharing with friends. Otherwise, it was to be confirmed in the copy that the records would be erased forever.</p>

<h1 id="feedback">Feedback</h1>

<p>People thought it was pretty funny but also really dumb — which was totally fine with me.</p>

<p>One thing that people did mention though, was that they would still be hestitant to really ”chat” with this bot, saying it wasn’t “secure,” or “trustworthy.”</p>

<p>In terms of actual security, I don’t know much about how privacy and secure storage of data works online. However, as I was aiming for a prototype, I was more interested in security from an emotional standpoint.</p>

<h3 id="promoting-confidentiality-and-truth">Promoting confidentiality and truth</h3>

<p>One of my favorite movies is the classic, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093779/"><em>The Princess Bride (1987)</em></a>. Something quite unique about the movie is how the main story is “framed” by the scenes from Ben Savage’s character’s bedroom. While they may seem unnecessary, they help the viewer suspend disbelief, immersing themselves in this fantastic world. Similarly, a confessional in a church’s walls, apart from creating anonymity, isolates the subject in a world that they enter and then leave, framing this experience and removing the actual confession from the rest of their life.</p>

<p>To emulate these experiences, I simply created a separate landing page and a conclusion page. The goal was to represent the chat as a separated experience, removing hesitation and the judgments of real life.</p>

<p><img src="/files/ugh_landing_end.png" alt="ugh framed experience" title="ugh. with landing and conclusion page" /></p>

<h1 id="final-product">Final Product</h1>

<p>Despite how simple and ridiculous “ugh.” is, I’m still quite proud of it and love linking it to people as a joke, when they’re trying to vent. I love how it started from a stupid idea into a real, working application, and has a funny story behind its conception.</p>
