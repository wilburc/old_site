## Professional Experience

### Associate Data Engineer, <a href='http://centro.net'>Centro</a> 
*6/2015–Present*


As part of the data-science team at Centro, I have two main responsibilities:

1. **Productization of data-science algorithms**. Machine-learning algorithms aren’t the most easily understood by stakeholders—it is my responsibility to present these in a simple, understandable manner. I create mockups and functioning prototypes to demonstrate practical applications for our team’s algorithms. Stakeholders can then realize this potential and pick them up for products. 

    - Create mockups and functioning prototypes (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python) 
    - Present complex data-science algorithms/ideas to stakeholders in a simple, understandable manner
    - Communicate between data scientists and project managers
    - Advocate for human-factors in data science products

2. **Analysis, Visualization, Presentation**. I extract, visualize, and analyze data. I then run additional analysis on interesting trends or phenomenon that emerge. We translate these findings into actionable insights that are then presented to media strategists. 

    - Extract data with SQL
    - Analyze/Visualize data with Python, identifying actionable insights
    - Present findings to media strategists/business stakeholders

### UI/UX Design Intern, <a href='http://metronome-software.com'>Metronome Software</a>
*6/2014–10/2014*


I worked on various aspects of our company’s products. Responsibilities included:

- Analysis and evaluation of current mobile/desktop experiences
- Recommending and implementing improvements in HTML/CSS/Python
- Writing software tutorials

### Software Development Intern, <a href='http://broadcom.com'>Broadcom Ltd.</a>
*6/2013–9/2013*

Within the Test Engineering team, I evaluated the current workflows of our engineers, and designed/created tools to improve them. I also participated in the Broadcom Intern Hackathon, where my team won 3rd place out of 14 teams by engineering a quad-copter to be controlled in flight using hand gestures (via Microsoft Kinect).

  1. Eliminated several weekly emails, meetings, and phone calls
  2. Managed documents and automatically parsed them for information
