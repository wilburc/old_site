intro:  A rant — with screenshots!

Few things on the internet really annoy me — but those that do, make me want to cry over their designer’s keyboards so they can never violate a user’s sanity ever again.

## I don’t want to think.

Account registration should not require any thought.  As a way to a means, it’s meant to be quick and painless. It *has* to be. <a href='https://medium.com/uie-brain-sparks/the-300-million-button-76b566ae5f73#.f9s0swo4i'>Several</a> <a href='https://www.nngroup.com/articles/optional-registration/'>studies</a> have shown that account registration is a wall that people aren’t willing to scale — unless they *really* want whatever lies on the other side.

## My worst online experience

Now, you may think that the password incident above was from an old, under-designed website. That may be true — but an incident equally egregious, an experience that claims the #1 spot in my “Worst digital experiences 1993–2016,” occurred at the hands of a company you’ve definitely heard of.

There’s a reason why I still hesitate to use iTunes for anything.

This is all under the assumption that I don’t know the answer to my security questions. I’ll save this for another post.

It’s very hard to switch your country preferences — especially if you don’t know your password.

My new password must be:

1. At least 8 characters
2. Contain both uppercase/lowercase letters
3. Have at least one number

Despite fulfilling all of the criteria, there was a *hidden* condition—that your password cannot be “too easy to guess.” I thought that was the whole point of the 3 criteria above.

I’m interested in seeing any studies that show that people generally use the same 2-3 passwords for all their accounts. I ended up using one of my fallback ones that miraculously *did* satisfy the 4th *hidden* requirement…

…and obviously, because of that, it’s already been used before and can’t be used again.
