title:  Literally the worst.
intro:  A rant — with screenshots!

Few things on the internet really annoy me — but those that do, make me want to cry over their designer’s keyboards so they can never violate a user’s sanity ever again.

I don’t care what’s on the other side of that account registration screen, I left immediately. 

## I don’t want to think.

Account registration should not require any thought. Really. As a way to a means, it’s meant to be quick and painless. It *has* to be. <a href='https://medium.com/uie-brain-sparks/the-300-million-button-76b566ae5f73#.f9s0swo4i'>Countless</a> <a href='https://www.nngroup.com/articles/optional-registration/'>studies</a> have shown that account registration is a wall that people aren’t willing to scale. 

## My worst online experience

Now, you may think that the password incident above was from an old, under-designed website. That may be true — but something similar, but even *worse* than this, an experience that claims the #1 spot in my “Worst digital experiences 1993–2016,” occurred at the hands of a company you’ve definitely heard of.

First of all, I have 3 iTunes accounts. Why?

1. I used to not live in the United States. It’s surprisingly difficult to switch your account country preferences
2. I had an iTunes gift card in one of my accounts, and credits are non-transferable <abbr>AFAIK</abbr>
3. I had to use my .edu account for something. I think.

But that’s besides the point. Let me show you *why* I still don’t use iTunes for anything.

![first step](/files/2_19_reset_pw_1.png "step 1")

I guess it’s sort of my fault for not knowing how to answer my security questions, but let’s blow past that.

![second step](/files/2_19_reset_pw_2.png "step 2")

Like I said earlier, it’s very hard to switch your country preferences — especially if you don’t know your password, obviously. Which I clearly don’t. But that’s fine, I can read it.


![third step](/files/2_19_reset_pw_3.png "step 3")

My new password must be:

1. At least 8 characters
2. Contain both uppercase/lowercase letters
3. Have at least one number

So not the *worst* criteria. But that’s not all.

![fourth step](/files/2_19_reset_pw_4.png "step 4")


Apparently it’s too easy to guess, **despite fulfilling* all of the criteria, which are *there* to make it harder to guess. What?

![fifth step](/files/2_19_reset_pw_5.png "step 5")



That’s okay — at this point, I tried a password I knew would work. The only one in my running list of passwords I use, that can be considered complicated.

And obviously, because of that, it’s already been used before.
