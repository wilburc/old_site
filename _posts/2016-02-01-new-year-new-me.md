intro: …because January doesn’t count — that was a test run.

I’ve gone through so many versions of a personal website within the past 12 months. It’s not that I’m that picky or anything, but things have to be <i>perfect</i>. 

And frankly, all the ones in the past were really bad.

This new site is built with the amazing <a href='http://jekyllrb.com'>Jekyll</a>, and with the added help of the equally amazing <a href='https://github.com/poole/poole'>Poole</a> template. Many thanks.

I know it might not seem like it given how poor my writing is, but I really do enjoy it. That, and I always seem to forget things and really should put down my thoughts and ideas. I’ll be writing posts every now and then for both myself and whoever’s reading. 

Happy New Year!<br><i>-Wilbur Chen</i>
