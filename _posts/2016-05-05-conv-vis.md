title:  Conversation Visualization
intro:  Could be fun, could be dumb

I’m a little surprised that few people have tried to visualize a *conversation*. As more and more of our correspondences take online message form, our conversations begin to represent various aspects of our lives. 

With a conversation transcript and some natural-language processing tools, we can potentially identify emotions, sentiment, and opinions—and how these flow throughout the conversation. 

We’ll see.
