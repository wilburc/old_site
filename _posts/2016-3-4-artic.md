title: The Art Institute of Chicago
intro: Free admission for Illinois residents on Thursday evenings.

If only I were an Illinois resident. 

“Is there a student discount?” I gingerly asked, presenting my battered U.C. Irvine ID. 

“Illinois residents get in free today,” she replied.

“Right, but-…okay. Thanks!”

I hurriedly collected the ticket and walked away confused, only realizing later that she may have thought U.C. stood for University of Chicago.

Not that I would mind paying the $19 student fee (or the $25 general fee that I *should* be paying). It truly is a privilege to gaze upon some of the most recognizable works of art in the world, admiring and absorbing the genius, emotion, and technique of their artists.

Or something like that. Honestly, I don’t know how to appreciate art. I can read the placards, I can relate the artists’ context and influences to the paintings, but I don’t feel anything as profound as you would expect from paintings held in such high regard. Gazing upon the series of Van Gogh’s iconic *The Bedroom*, their juxtaposition representing his gradually skewing perception of “home,” the only thought going through my head was “this would make for a good Snapchat video.” I panned my phone across the triad, only to end at the gentle but disapproving look of the attendant, gesturing to the “no video” sign for probably the thousandth time that day.

Am I just emotionless, or another millennial in search of meaning and Instagram likes? Has my life been so shallow that I can’t relate to any of the artists’ struggles and feelings? It’s not that I don’t *get* artwork, I took an introductory art history course in college, so *I know what I speak of*. 

Does the value of art lie in how effectively the artist depicted an emotion—froze it in time, preserving that exact moment? Or how well it tells the artists’ story or message? Perhaps the artists’ technique and skill with a brush engender admiration and create the value?

At this point I think it’s fairly obvious that it’s a combination of all of these factors and maybe more. No amount of looking for museum tour groups/stalking SAIC professors can tell us what the art means to us. 

But the question that arises is—if art is so subjective, *why* do some artists become so famous and revered? There has to be *some* formula, some combination of the above attributes, that creates the perfect piece.

You’re probably thinking, “wow this guy does *not* know what he’s talking about.”

And you’re right.
