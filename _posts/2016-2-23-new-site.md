Over the past 12 months, I’ve probably created at least 30 versions of my personal portfolio site. 

*“Wow, what a perfectionist!”*

*Maaaaybe*. But the truth is, I really just had no idea what I was doing.* 

80-20. Or rather, 20-80. 

**Not that I really do now*

## Technologies

I used to build sites out of nothing but pure, unadulterated HTML/CSS/JavaScript. Out of nothing but ignorance, maybe. You can probably imagine how messy *that* got. It was like building a house out of wet cardboard and stripped yarn.

One year of constant iteration and a <a href='http://typekit.com'>TypeKit</a> subscription later, I dedicated a weekend to nothing but brunch and this site, and today I humbly present the result.

- Built with <a href='http://jekyllrb.com'>Jekyll</a>, graciously assisted by <a href='http://getpoole.com/'>Poole</a>
- Image zooming made possible and easy with <a href='https://github.com/fat/zoom.js/tree/master'>zoom.js</a> 
- <a href='http://www.exljbris.com/'>exljbris</a>’ beautiful Calluna and Calluna Sans served by <a href='http://typekit.com'>Adobe Typekit</a>.

A more detailed write-up with images and stuff may or may not be in the works.

Good night,
