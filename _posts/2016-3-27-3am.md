title:  3 a.m.
intro: The best and worst time of day.
---

I should note that it currently is *not* 3am. 

My favorite time of day (apart from brunch, obviously) is 3 a.m. There’s something about sitting at my desk, illuminated only by the glow of a monitor, the silence disturbed only by the occasional passing car. I wouldn’t really describe it as a “creative” moment—not that it isn’t. Rather, it’s the perfect time to evaluate your life and goals from a much higher level. 

3 a.m. is perfectly separate from both the preceding and the upcoming day. 3 a.m. is not impaired by the past day‘s events, nor is it suppressed by the coming day’s plans. 3 a.m. wants you to focus on the future, a bird’s-eye view of your grand scheme—how you fit into the world. 3 a.m. brings motivation and inspiration in such a pure form.

The worst part is waking up the next day, brought back to the immediacy and dread of life, reviewing the writing, drawing, or creative of 3 a.m. This glimpse into the naïveté and stupor of 3 a.m. Things that seemed perfectly reasonable, personal, and *genius* are suddenly ridiculous and callow. 

I guess the question is: would you rather be 3 a.m., or 9 (let’s be real—11 a.m.)?
