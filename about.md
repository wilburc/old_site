##Hello

I’m Wilbur — like the pig, or the airplane guy. I’m a designer who builds products to make people’s lives easier, because life is hard enough already. Interests include pleasant typography, musicals, and documentaries about food. Hobbies include discussing proper use of the word “hella,” making guacamole, and keeping up with the Kardashians.

As a designer, I’ve worked on tools used by people such as engineers, soldiers, and students. To me, the most important aspects of a product are its value and usability. What sort of utility does it provide, and how easily is this result recognized and achieved? I particularly enjoy working on enterprise or business tools. I find them to be so tragically underdesigned, and a great opportunity to help people work better and more happily. 

Right now I’m living in Chicago, where I use the Snapchat temperature filter daily, to let my friends in California know what they’re “missing out” on. 


See you around,<br><i>-Wilbur Chen</i>
