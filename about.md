# Hello

\<img src='/files/IMG_2154.png' data-action='zoom'\>

## I’m Wilbur
—like the pig, or the airplane guy. I’m a designer who wants to make people’s lives easier. Interests include pleasant typography, musicals, and documentaries about food. Hobbies include discussing use of the word “hella,” making guacamole, and watching trashy reality TV.

## Design

My interest in design was born from the plight of the employee. Noticing the dire lack of well-designed tools in the workplace and other settings, I set out to create experiences that boost productivity, create value, and maybe inspire a bit of joy. Previous experiences include building internal tools for engineers at \<a href='https://www.broadcom.com/'\>Broadcom\</a\>, designing apps for the military at \<a href='http://www.metronome-software.com/'\>Metronome Software\</a\>, and making all sorts of fun things at \<a href='http://uci.edu'\>UC Irvine\</a\>. 

While originally from the Bay Area, I’m currently braving my first winter in Chicago, where I work with productization, visualization, and design within the Data Science team at \<a href='http://centro.net'\>Centro\</a\>.  

See you around,\<br\>\<i\>-Wilbur Chen\</i\>
