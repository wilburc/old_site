# Hello

<img src='/files/IMG_2154.png' data-action='zoom'>

I’m Wilbur — like the pig, or the airplane guy. I’m a designer who builds products to make people’s lives easier. Interests include pleasant typography, musicals, and documentaries about food. Hobbies include discussing use of the word “hella,” making guacamole, and watching trashy reality TV.

## Design

My interest in design was borne from the plight of the employee. Noticing the dire lack of well-designed tools in the workplace and other settings, I set out to create products that boost productivity, create value, and produce joy. Previous experiences include building internal tools for engineers at <a href='https://www.broadcom.com/'>Broadcom</a>, designing apps for the military at <a href='http://www.metronome-software.com/'>Metronome Software</a>, and making all sorts of fun things at <a href='http://uci.edu'>UC Irvine</a>. 

While originally from the Bay Area, I’m currently freezing in Chicago, where I work at <a href='http://centro.net'>Centro</a>.  

See you around,<br><i>-Wilbur Chen</i>
